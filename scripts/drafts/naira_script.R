# The data for this week’s module come from the paper, Blood biomarker discovery for autism spectrum disorder: A proteomic analysis (Hewitson et al., 2021). This study investigated autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and aimed to identify a panel of proteins that could serve as biomarkers for ASD risk. Blood samples were collected from 76 boys with ASD and 78 typically developing (TD) boys, with ages spanning 18-months to 8 years. The mean age of the ASD participants was 5.6 years, and the mean age of TD participants was 5.7 years. Additional characteristics were recorded, including ethnicity of the participants, presence of co-morbid conditions, and use of prescription medications. For the ASD group, each participant was given an Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) total score, which provided a continuous measure of overall ASD symptom severity.
# 
# In order to quantify protein abundance in the blood samples, a proteomic analysis of serums was performed using SomaLogic’s SOMAScanTM assay 1.3K platform, and a total of 1,1,317 proteins were measured. After quality control procedures, 192 proteins that did not meet reliability standards were excluded, leaving 1,125 proteins for analysis. The protein abundance data were normalized by first applying a log10 transformation and then a z-transformation. To deal with outliers, any z-transformed values less than -3 and greater than 3 were clipped to -3 and 3, respectively.
